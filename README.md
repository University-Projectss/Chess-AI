# Chess AI

 I don't like the AI course from college so I decided to build an AI on my own.

## Rating

 With depth 3, it is evaluated with 1100 ELO.

## Dependencies

[chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/index.html) to display the board

[chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) to generate the moves, check for mates...long story short, this library implements the chess game logic


## Algorithms

This AI will use the minimax algortihm with alpha-beta pruning.
