# Chess AI

I don't like the AI course from college so I decided to build an AI on my own.

## Rating

With depth 3, it is evaluated with 1100 ELO(Draw with 1100 chess.com engine).

With depth 4, it is evaluated with 1300 ELO(Draw with 1300 chess.com engine).

## Dependencies

[chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/index.html) to display the board

[chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) to generate the moves, check for mates...long story short, this library implements the chess game logic

## Algorithms

This AI will use the minimax algortihm with alpha-beta pruning.

## Future development

The algorithm should learn from every game
